#  Heart Disease Prediction Web App

This is a simple machine learning web application built with **Python**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Streamlit** that predicts whether a person has heart disease based on medical input parameters.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- User-friendly interface built with Streamlit  
- Predicts presence of heart disease using a trained ML model  
- Uses logistic regression (or other model) trained on the `heart.csv` dataset  
- Real-time prediction with model saved using Pickle
